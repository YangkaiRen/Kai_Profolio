# [Cyclistic bike-share analysis](https://github.com/YangkaiRen/Bike_Share_Analysis/blob/main/Bike-Share01.ipynb)
In this project , Suppose I was a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director
of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships.  So we can confirm our business task is to design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members.  Therefore, I want to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, my team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.

In order to answer the question, I use the steps of the data analysis process: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share and act to find the truth of data and visualize the finding step by step.

# [FitBit Smart Devices Trends Analysis](https://github.com/YangkaiRen/Fitbit_Smart_Devices_Trends_Analysis/blob/master/BitFit_Case_Study.ipynb)
Bellabeat is a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women. Cofounder and Chief Creative Officer of Bellabeat, believes that analyzing smart
device fitness data could help unlock new growth opportunities for the company. My task is to analyze FitBit smart device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices. For performing task, I use the steps of the data analysis process: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share and act to guide me to find the trends in FitBit smart device usage. Then answer the question about how could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers and how could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?



# [Used car prices prediction contest project in Tianchi of Alibaba](https://github.com/YangkaiRen/used_car_DA)


*	Used python to program the advanced Machine Learning technology on used car market data from Alibaba (400k data and 15 anonymousâ€™ variables)           
*	Used mixed models (LGMBRegressor and CatBoostRegressor) based on EDA, preprocessing, and feature engineering to build a regression algorithm model and achieve the 439.83 MAE on the test data (top 3% in 12912 competing teams).         
*	Utilized target encoding and feature crossing technology to create new features and select important features by embedding          
*	Optimized LGBMRegressor and CatBoostRegressor using GridsearchCV to reach the best model        





# [Machine Learning Analysis on Census Bureau Dataset](https://github.com/YangkaiRen/Census-Bureau)


*	Developed Machine Learning technology on Census Bureau Dataset(50k data)            
*	Used Filter method to select a subset of features by the correlation between features and class label.            
*	Used Ensemble method to generate a classification algorithm from different machine learning classifiers(KNN, NaÃ¯ve Bays, Logistic Regression) to classify test dataset        
*	Utilized confusion Matrix and accuracy score to evaluate machine learning classifier accuracy achieve 85.2%.            
*	Create an ML pipeline to automate the iterative processes of data transformation and building estimators          
*	The pipelines offer efficient methods to apply to transform numerical and category features automatically.
