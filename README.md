# [Project 1. Used car prices prediction contest project in Tianchi of Alibaba](https://github.com/YangkaiRen/used_car_DA)


*	Used python to program the advanced Machine Learning technology on used car market data from Alibaba (400k data and 15 anonymousâ€™ variables)           
*	Used mixed models (LGMBRegressor and CatBoostRegressor) based on EDA, preprocessing, and feature engineering to build a regression algorithm model and achieve the 439.83 MAE on the test data (top 3% in 12912 competing teams).         
*	Utilized target encoding and feature crossing technology to create new features and select important features by embedding          
*	Optimized LGBMRegressor and CatBoostRegressor using GridsearchCV to reach the best model        





# [Project 2. Machine Learning Analysis on Census Bureau Dataset](https://github.com/YangkaiRen/Census-Bureau)


*	Developed Machine Learning technology on Census Bureau Dataset(50k data)            
*	Used Filter method to select a subset of features by the correlation between features and class label.            
*	Used Ensemble method to generate a classification algorithm from different machine learning classifiers(KNN, NaÃ¯ve Bays, Logistic Regression) to classify test dataset        
*	Utilized confusion Matrix and accuracy score to evaluate machine learning classifier accuracy achieve 85.2%.            
*	Create an ML pipeline to automate the iterative processes of data transformation and building estimators          
*	The pipelines offer efficient methods to apply to transform numerical and category features automatically.
