# [Cyclistic bike-share analysis](https://github.com/YangkaiRen/Bike_Share_Analysis/blob/main/Bike-Share01.ipynb)
Cyclistic is a bike-share company in Chicago
The business goal for this case aims at increasing riders’ conversions to annual membership from casual bicycle users in the bike-share company Cyclists.

+	Defined the differences using bikes between members and casual riders as the objective trying to solve
+	Processed the data to be squeaky clean by removing missing and incorrect data, and adding new attributions
+	Aggregated and created new category tables to find truth by the quantitative analysis methods of user segmentation, time series, time contrast, subdivision, etc
+	Presented 6 differences been found by visualization, shared the results in the report



Suppose I was a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director
of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships.  So we can confirm our business task is to design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members.  Therefore, I want to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, my team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.

To answer the question, I use the steps of the data analysis process: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share and act to find the truth of data and visualize the finding step by step.

# [Uncovering Wellness Trends behind Fitbit Smart Devices](https://github.com/YangkaiRen/Fitbit_Smart_Devices_Trends_Analysis/blob/master/BitFit_Case_Study.ipynb)
Bellabeat is a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women. Co-founder and Chief Creative Officer of Bellabeat, believes that analyzing smart device fitness data could help unlock new growth opportunities for the company. My task is to analyze FitBit smart device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices.    

The purpose of this project is to develop the marketing strategy for the company based on the available tracked activities data via analyzing intelligent device data to gain insight into how customers are using their smart devices.   

+	Identified and framed the analytical problem by asking 3 effective questions
+	Improved data quality using Pandas and Numpy packages in Python to clean, filter, and transform the data
+	Analyzed 33 participants’ usages of the device and 4 health indicators about physical activity, sleep time, daily steps, and calorie consumption based on different types of analytics, and visualized the findings
+	Shared 5 findings along with constructed 5 high-level recommendations for marketing strategy


# [Used car prices project ](https://github.com/YangkaiRen/used_car_DA)
This project is the data science competition organized by Tianchi of Allibaba.

+	Explored data structure, and features correlations by using EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) Technical
+	Improved data quality by changing data structure and transformed variables, including missing data imputation, log transformation, data type transformation, and feature selection
+	Increased model performance by creating new features utilized target encoding and feature crossing technology
+	Realized Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 439.83 using supervised learning models LGMBRegressor and CatBoostRegressor, ranked top 2% on the leader board.

     

# [Machine Learning Analysis on Census Bureau Dataset](https://github.com/YangkaiRen/Census-Bureau)

# [Covid-19 Tableau Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/allen.ren/viz/covid-19dashboard_16403069544190/Dashboard3)
Covid-19 changes our life these years. So I hope to create a Covid-19 dashboard myself to see the trends of the world. In this project, I choose SQL to be my code language. I Built and collated complex SQL queries to conduct data cleaning and validation on data sets; checked the consistency, accuracy, and continuity of data with leverage of SQL. Analyzed various aspects of the COVID-19 dataset using SQL to understand the severity of the situation in the most affected countries and regions. Finally, I design interactive dashboards in Tableau which add value to society.
