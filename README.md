# [Cyclistic bike-share analysis](https://github.com/YangkaiRen/Bike_Share_Analysis/blob/main/Bike-Share01.ipynb)
In this project , Suppose I was a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director
of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships.  So we can confirm our business task is to design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members.  Therefore, I want to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, my team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.

In order to answer the question, I use the steps of the data analysis process: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share and act to find the truth of data and visualize the finding step by step.

# [FitBit Smart Devices Trends Analysis](https://github.com/YangkaiRen/Fitbit_Smart_Devices_Trends_Analysis/blob/master/BitFit_Case_Study.ipynb)
Bellabeat is a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women. Cofounder and Chief Creative Officer of Bellabeat, believes that analyzing smart
device fitness data could help unlock new growth opportunities for the company. My task is to analyze FitBit smart device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices. For performing task, I use the steps of the data analysis process: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share and act to guide me to find the trends in FitBit smart device usage. Then answer the question about how could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers and how could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?



# [Used car prices prediction contest project in Tianchi of Alibaba](https://github.com/YangkaiRen/used_car_DA)

This project is a machine learning competition. In order to get a better result. I used EDA technical to find the data structure and trends, extracted important features, checked the outlier, missing values, logic error, and format issue, Created the new features with target encoding and feature crossing technology, and created a regression model to predict the price with 439.83 MAE accuracy on a validation. Finally, I ranked top 2% in all teams.
      

# [Machine Learning Analysis on Census Bureau Dataset](https://github.com/YangkaiRen/Census-Bureau)

This project was motivated by my drive to learn about the machine learning pipeline and classification algorithm. In the project, I cleaned the data, encoded the discrete feature with one-hot encoding, created the machine learning pipeline and classifier model to classify people's income by the features with 85.2% accuracy on the Census Bureau Dataset.
