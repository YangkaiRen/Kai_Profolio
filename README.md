# [Project 1. Tianchi _ used car transaction price prediction data analysis](https://github.com/YangkaiRen/used_car_DA)

●  The question is based on the used car market and requires players to predict the transaction price of used cars. This is a typical regression problem.    
●  The total data volume exceeds 400k and contains 31 columns of variable information, 15 of which are anonymous variables.   
●  Utilized Mean Squared Error(MSE) technology to evaluate models.    
●  I am an individual entrant. My method uses mixed models (LGMB and CatBoost) based on EDA, preprocessing, and feature engineering. Experiments show that my method outperforms most approaches.   
● There are 12912 teams competing in the contest. My score is 439.83. The ranking is 394. Better than 97% teams( 394 /
12912 = 3%).
