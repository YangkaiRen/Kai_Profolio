# [Cyclistic bike-share analysis](https://github.com/YangkaiRen/Bike_Share_Analysis/blob/main/Bike-Share01.ipynb)
Cyclistic is a bike-share company in Chicago
The business goal for this case aims at increasing riders’ conversions to annual membership from casual bicycle users in the bike-share company Cyclists.

+	Defined the differences using bikes between members and casual riders as the objective trying to solve
+	Processed the data to be squeaky clean by removing missing and incorrect data, and adding new attributions
+	Aggregated and created new category tables to find truth by the quantitative analysis methods of user segmentation, time series, time contrast, subdivision, etc
+	Presented 6 differences been found by visualization, shared the results in the report

# [Uncovering Wellness Trends behind Fitbit Smart Devices](https://github.com/YangkaiRen/Fitbit_Smart_Devices_Trends_Analysis/blob/master/BitFit_Case_Study.ipynb)
Fitbit is a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products. The purpose of this project is to develop the marketing strategy for the company based on the available tracked activities data via analyzing intelligent device data to gain insight into how customers are using their smart devices.   

+	Identified and framed the analytical problem by asking 3 effective questions
+	Improved data quality using Pandas and Numpy packages in Python to clean, filter, and transform the data
+	Analyzed 33 participants’ usages of the device and 4 health indicators about physical activity, sleep time, daily steps, and calorie consumption based on different types of analytics, and visualized the findings
+	Shared 5 findings along with constructed 5 high-level recommendations for marketing strategy


# [Used car prices project ](https://github.com/YangkaiRen/used_car_DA)
This project is the data science competition organized by Tianchi of Allibaba.

+	Explored data structure, and features correlations by using EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) Technical
+	Improved data quality by changing data structure and transformed variables, including missing data imputation, log transformation, data type transformation, and feature selection
+	Increased model performance by creating new features utilized target encoding and feature crossing technology
+	Realized Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 439.83 using supervised learning models LGMBRegressor and CatBoostRegressor, ranked top 2% on the leader board.

     

# [Machine Learning Analysis on Census Bureau Dataset](https://github.com/YangkaiRen/Census-Bureau)
This project was motivated by my drive to learn about the best practices of classification models and the machine learning pipeline.

+ Developed Machine Learning technology on Census Bureau Dataset
+ cleaned the data, encoded the discrete feature with one-hot encoding
+ created the machine learning pipeline and multiple classifiers to classify people's income by the features
+ Used Confusion Matrix to evaluate each machine learning classifiers. Achieved 85.2% accuracy
      

# [Covid-19 Tableau Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/allen.ren/viz/covid-19dashboard_16403069544190/Dashboard3)
Covid-19 changes our life these years. So I hope to create a Covid-19 dashboard myself to see the trends of the world. In this project, I choose SQL to be my code language. I Built and collated complex SQL queries to conduct data cleaning and validation on data sets; checked the consistency, accuracy, and continuity of data with leverage of SQL. Analyzed various aspects of the COVID-19 dataset using SQL to understand the severity of the situation in the most affected countries and regions. Finally, I design interactive dashboards in Tableau which add value to society.
