# [Project 1. Tianchi _ used car transaction price prediction data analysis](https://github.com/YangkaiRen/used_car_DA)

+  The question is based on the used car market and requires players to predict the transaction price of used cars. This is a typical regression problem.    
+  The total data volume exceeds 400k and contains 31 columns of variable information, 15 of which are anonymous variables.   
+  Utilized Mean Squared Error(MSE) technology to evaluate models.    
+  I am an individual entrant. My method uses mixed models (LGMB and CatBoost) based on EDA, preprocessing, and feature engineering. Experiments show that my method outperforms most approaches.   
+ There are 12912 teams competing in the contest. My score is 439.83. The ranking is 394. Better than 97% teams( 394 /
12912 = 3%).


# Project 2. Machine Learning Analysis on Census Bureau Dataset.


+ The Census Dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository. The goal is to train a binary classifier to predict the income (50k instances and 14 attributes in the dataset).   
+ Developed an ML pipeline to automate the iterative processes of data transformation and building estimators. The pipelines offer efficient methods to automatically apply to preprocess and feature engineering to numerical and category features.   
+ Used Logistic Regression classifier to classify test data and utilized accuracy score to find the accuracy of the model. Finally get 85.2% accuracy.
