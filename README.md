# [Project 1. Tianchi _ used car transaction price prediction data analysis](https://github.com/YangkaiRen/used_car_DA)


The project is based on the used car market and requires players to predict the transaction price of used cars. It is a typical regression problem. The total data volume exceeds 400k and contains 31 columns of variable information, 15 of which are anonymous variables. I use MSE(mean suqared erro) technology to evalueate models.    

For this project, My method uses mixed models (LGMB and CatBoost) based on EDA, preprocessing, and feature engineering. utlized GridsearchCV to optimize. Finally, I choose Weighted arithmetic mean to be my ensemble method. Experiments show that my method outperforms most approaches.



# Project 2. Machine Learning Analysis on Census Bureau Dataset.


The Census Dataset is collected from UCI Machine Learning Repository. The goal of the dataset is to train a binary classifier to predict the income. The total data volume is 50k instances and 14 attributes. None anonymous varibles in it.    



For this question. I bulided the Logistic Regression classifier to classify the income of data. I was able to get the model to predict the income with 85.2 accuracy after minimal tuning. 

 Developed an ML pipeline to automate the iterative processes of data transformation and building estimators. The pipelines offer efficient methods to automatically apply to preprocess and feature engineering to numerical and category features.
